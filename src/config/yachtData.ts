    description: "TO ORDER : Starting price without options! Impossible to look away from right from the very first glance: the design element which first affirms the character of the Sessantadue 62 is its vertical bow. A line which connects the sea and sky, and which accentuates the naval allure of the yacht. The waterline is lengthened, with the vessel benefiting in terms of audacity and muscularity, but without suffering in terms of harmony of forms, which is a distinctive element of Cranchi Yachts' new flybridge models. The information provided is believed to be accurate. However, they are not guaranteed and cannot form the basis of a contract.",

    description: "Project SPITFIRE is a collaboration between some of the most well-known names in their respected fields of expertise. Iconic design firm Bannenberg & Rowell and Lateral Naval Architects have joined forces with ARES Shipyard based in Antalya, Turkey to bring to you SPITFIRE, a diesel electric hybrid sport yacht with expansive exterior deck spaces, beach club & wellness area, floor to ceiling glass walls, timeless lines and fantastic capabilities. She is sub 500GRT, has an impressive top speed of 22 knots which is appropriate with her low profile sport lines yet at economical speeds still has a 3,500nm range. SPITFIRE sleeps 10 guests in 5 cabins and has expansive crew accommodations for up to 9 in 5 cabins. Built to RINA Commercial, Green Plus classification, LY3.\n\nThe design of SPITFIRE calls on the heritage of the legendary Spitfire fighter aircraft with the goal of creating its own legacy. Lateral Naval Architects have developed the hull form to be fast, efficient and keeping with the future implemented a diesel electric hybrid package which optimizes running costs with multiple modes to be applied to a variety of conditions when cruising. Bannenberg & Rowell has been able to create a light and airy interior d√©cor that incorporates glass, light woods & textures that give a zen like feeling which I feel translates to modern day yachting. SPITFIRE will redefine the sport yacht segment of the market and establish ARES Shipyard as one of the premier builders in this segment of the market.\n\nConstruction on SPITFIRE will begin in February 2025 and is a 24 month construction period with delivery scheduled for Spring 2027. SPITFIRE has been fully developed with all technical specifications for Lateral Naval Architects finalized as well as the interior & exterior design elements by Bannenberg & Rowell.\n\nARES Shipyard located in the Antalya Free Trade Zone is one of the most impressive facilities I| have seen of any shipyard not just in Turkey. ARES is extremely well respected as the country's largest exporter of military & commercial vessels. This award winning, family run operation has now entered the yachting segment of the market with every intention of duplicating their success with SPITFIRE. Financially strong with unlimited resources, expect to hear more from ARES in the coming year.",
